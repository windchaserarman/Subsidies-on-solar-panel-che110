    <img src="solarimg.jpg" alt="solar panel" width="60%" height="55%" id="bigimg">

    <p>When we discuss about solar energy, then we think about pricing of solar system, 
        and then after the subsidy scheme of solar panels. Let us know about government solar subsidy
         scheme & procedure of each states of India. You will be able to find the following information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How can I get subsidy on solar?</li>
        <li>Where can I apply for solar subsidy?</li>
        <li>Who is the right person of this scheme?</li>
        <li>How much can I get subsidy amount?</li>
        <li>How much does solar subsidy amount of solar system in each states?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <div class="meaning">
        <h2>What is Solar Subsidy?</h2>
        <p>A solar subsidy is like a financial bonus or help that you can get when you decide to use <a href="https://www.enelgreenpower.com/learning-hub/renewable-energies/solar-energy" target="_blank">solar energy</a>
             for your home or business. It's a way for the government or other organizations to encourage people 
             to use solar power by making it a bit cheaper or more financially rewarding.</p>

    <h2>Why does Government give Solar Subsidy?</h2>
    <p>India aimed to install 40GW of residential solar panels but reached only 5GW by 2021.
         The revised target is 280GW by 2030, necessitating an annual installation of 10GW. 
         The government encourages home installations, allowing customers to choose any solar provider. 
         After installation, photos are sent to the local electricity board.
        <br>
        Governments offer solar subsidies to promote:
        <ol style="line-height:2;">

        <h2>Subsidy Benefits</h2>
        <p>There are three parties involved in the process: <span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Customers, 2. Channel Partners, 3. DISCOMS.</span>
            
                <h4>#1. Customer Benefits</h4>

                <p>The subsidy is only for homes—individual ones and big apartments, not for businesses. It's 
                    only for solar systems connected to the grid, without a battery. Since getting a solar 
                    system is a big expense, the subsidy helps people by giving them financial support. It makes
                     it easier for them to invest in solar energy and lightens the financial load..</p>

                     <table id="customertable">
                        <tr>

                      <p>Homeowners can only install a solar system and claim subsidy through the state DISCOM.
                       They will share customer details and register the nearest channel partner.
                        You can find all states DISCOMS from <a href="https://solarrooftop.gov.in/grid_others/discomPortalLink" target="_blank">here.</a>
                    
                    </p>

                <h4>#2. Channel Partner Benefits</h4>

                <p>Channel Partners gain more customers and business. While a regular person may find it
                    challenging to navigate the subsidy application process, even if they really want it, 
                    that's where the Channel Partner steps in. They collaborate with the customer and
                    government departments to speed up the subsidy application process, making it easier for the customer.</p>

                <h4>#3. DISCOMS Benefits</h4>

                <p>Homes use less power, so they can contribute more electricity to businesses. We understand that 
                    businesses need more electricity than homes.<br>
                    The customer is happy with the financial help, the Channel Partner is happy with a new customer,
                    and the government is pleased because it's closer to reaching its solar installation goal.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Both central and state offer subsidy schemes to people for installing solar rooftop systems.
                 The central government pays a 30% subsidy for these systems to states in general categories.
                  For special states like states such as Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir
                   and Lakshadweep, subsidy of up to 70% is given by the central government.
                <br>
                To avail subsidy, the average cost of installation of rooftop PV system without subsidy should
                 be around Rs 60,000 - 70,000. In order to avail generation-based incentive, the customer should
                  generate 1100 kWh - 1500 kWh per year.</p>

                <br>
                <p>A person who is interested in getting a subsidy needs to follow some protocols.
                   He will have to contact their electricity provider (or may even apply online with
                    necessary documentation) who will visit the installation site for a review and give
                     approval. Then the electricity provider visits for inspection. Customers can then avail the subsidy amount.</p>
